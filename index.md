# Autonomous Car 
The self driving car project is a miniture representation of  autonomous of vehicular transportation. With the ability to drive, navigate obstacles, modify pace to match surroundings, detect other vehicles and moving objects, the car demonstrates the future of transportation.

# Final Milestone


for my third milestone, and final milestone, I have smoothed out my code, added two ultrasonic sensors, and an initiation switch. in my code, I also have coded the robot to speed up or slow down based on how far it is from an obbject or environmental obstacle. the ultrasonic sensors were added to give the car a better understanding of it's environment and more control over navigation. I added the on/off switch to minimize the hassle of powering the robot on/off. From a technical standpoint, the ultrasonic sensors work by transmitting infrared waves, and based off the frequency of waves returning to the sensor, the robot is able to determine how far it is from a given object. Furthermore, the on/off switch works predominantly through code, where the arduino is told, that when the switch is turned on the car must preform the code, and when the switch is turned off to stop all movement. Reflecting on my time at BlueStamp, I faced quite a few challenges, some of them being the imbalanced motors, difficulty interpreting instructions, and unfimiliarity with electronic devices and instruments. I overcame all of these challenges through research and diligent work. On the flipside, some of my biggest triumphs at BlueStamp were finally getting the car to move in all four directions, independently being able to program my autonomous car, and implementing modifications independently. Following the conclusion of BlueStamp, I hope to constinue to learn more about robotics and how to create a furhter autonomous robots using a variety of techniques.

# Modifications 

For my modifications, I have added two more ultrasonic sensors, an on/off switch, LED tail lights, LED head lights, and a car horn, to the original autonomous car design by [sunfounder.org]([url](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/3in1-kit-v2/en/latest/car_project/car_auto.html)). I faced a handfull of challenges during my modifications, but the main one was struggling to find usable parts given my time constraint of the program. another big challenge I faced was having enough digital and analog pins on my arduino as well as having to get creative with how ground and power was provided to the three breadboards. Some things I learned during this modification process was how to wire multiple breadboards, Ohm's law, and the difference between analogPin and digitalPin. 

# Second Milestone (6/26/24)

For my second milestone, I elected to program the line sensor, ultrasonic, and object sensors. Given the application of these sensors, the robotic car is now able to navigate its environment autonomously. The new sensors allow the car to function by helping the car to detect objects, thus allowing it to manuver around obstacles. Some issues I have run ito when attatching and programming the sensors were: incorrect use of digitalWrite and analogWrite, poor sensor sensetivity, and failing to state integers in void setup. Through a dedicated week, I was able to work through these challenges and was eventually able to get my car to maneuver its environment by itself. As stated in the previous milestone, I also faced the challenge of having imbalanced motors, I was able to fix this through adjusting the speed of the individual motors. Next, for my third milestone, I plan to adjust the sensors and coding so the car is able to move smoothly. I also plan to program an initiation button to make the process of turning the car on an off more efficiant. 


<!--For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:

# First Milestone (6/14/24)

The project I chose to build this summer at BlueStamp is the self drving, or autonomous car. The self driving car project,  is a robot that is able to navigate through a course with no human intervention. The end result car should be able to detect and navigate around crosswalks, moving objects, static objects, vehicles, as well as stay in the correct lane.  For my first milestone, I have constructed a basic circuit on the drive base that allows the robot car to move forward continously. From a technical standpoint, the circiuit works by deriving power provided by the 9v battery that is then directed to the arduino and distributed to the motors. Because of this, the car is moving continuously in a straight plane with no stoping point or directional change. Some challenges I faced in the construction so far are having to restart due to not having the correct instruction manual, and reciving motors that did not have the same base speed. I eventually plan to fix this imbalance in milestone 2, along with adding directional commands using the line tracking and object detectiting sensors. 

<!--For your first milestone, describe what your project is and how you plan to build it. You can include:
- An explanation about the different components of your project and how they will all integrate together
- Technical progress you've made so far
- Challenges you're facing and solving in your future milestones
- What your plan is to complete your project

# Main Project (Track Construction)

(insert photo here madam)

For my project, I elected to construct a track for the car to run on. constructed of cardboard, paper, and tape, the car provides a clear and clean course for the car to demonstrate it's autonomous abilites. Littered with obstacles of multiple kinds, the car showcases its ability to handle a myriad of obstacles and maintain consistant accuracy. A challenge I faced during this construction was unsurity of what materials to use and what materials would be most cost effective. Eventually I settled on using paper and cardboard because it was already availible and easy to find.


# Starter Project

For my starter project, I chose the BlueStamp Arduino starter. Using a breadboard, arduino, wires, button, and motor, I created a circuit that, when the button is pressed makes the motor spin. This project works by deriving power from the computer which is distributed by the arduino to the circuit. the motor is allowed to spin when the button is pressed, and the circuit is complete.  I chose this project because I thought that it would give me practice in skills I would need for my main project, the self driving car.  The main challenge I had when creating this project was soldering. It was a struggle to solder the arduino to the sheild at the angle required, forcing me to become creative with my soldering technique. Next, I will use these skills to aid in the construction of my self driving car.


# Code for Starter Project 


```c++
const int buttonPin=2;  //the number of the pushbutton pin
const int motorPin=9;  // the number of the motor pin

//variables will change:
int buttonState=2;  //variable for reading the pushbutton status

void setup() {
  pinMode(motorPin,OUTPUT);
  pinMode(buttonPin,INPUT);
 }

void loop() {
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);
  //check if the pushbutton is pressed. If it is, the buttonState is HIGH:
    if(buttonState == LOW) {
      // turn MOTOR on:
        digitalWrite(motorPin, LOW);
      } else if(buttonState == HIGH) {
        // turn MOTOR off:
        digitalWrite(motorPin, HIGH);
      }
  }
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
